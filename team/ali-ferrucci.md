Hi, my name is Alexandra (everyone just calls me Ali). 
I am familiar with Java, Python, SQL, Angular, bootstrap, and languages we have covered in class.
I have web dev experience in two internships but it been a while since
I have created a project so I am a little bit rusty. Also, for most of my work, I did not work with setting 
up databases just connecting to them. I don't have any specific ideas for the projects. I am open to anything.
