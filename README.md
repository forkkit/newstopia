## Overview

We are building a news app with a focus on users' mental health that allows more control over the type of content consumed.
Users will be able to filter out negative articles from various sources. They can also filter out certain topics that upset them. We are considering showing stats about the article's trustworthiness as well.
This makes readers less vulnerable to emotional-manipulation tactics, or simply lets them see the world in a more positive light.

## Topic Requirements

- Ajax - for interfacing with the news and sentiment APIs
- Mobile - since most news consumption is on mobile devices
